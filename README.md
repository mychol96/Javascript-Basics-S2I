<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://mychol96.github.io/Javascript-Basics-S2I/)

Basket-Scoreboard is the final project for [start2impact](https://www.start2impact.it/)'s module "JavaScript Basics" in the Full-stack developer course.

### The assignment:

Develop a JS app that lets the user increment or decrement the counter value. Entering the page, the user should see: 0 set as the counter value, and two buttons (+ and -) to change said value.

### Requirements:

- The app must be developed with JS, without the help of Jquery or any framework.
- The buttons, as well as the counter, have to be through JS.
- Additional features may be added if necessary.

## Development

### The idea


The theme I chose is a realistic Basketball Scoreboard.

In the month of July, I organized a basketball tournament in my city and needed a basketball scoreboard. Instead of purchasing one, I decided to build it myself.

I designed the scoreboard as a counter with three buttons: "+" to increase the score, "-" to decrease the score, and "RESET" to reset the score to zero. To enhance the readability of the score, I incorporated a console that appears and disappears using the ":hover" effect.

To make the buttons look as realistic as possible, I played around with shadows to create a 3D effect. I wanted the scoreboard to have a dynamic feel, so I added a video in the background featuring highlights from the previous year's event.

The whole HTML elements and the functions are implemented through Javascript as 
required by project assignment.
